            The Anish Jadhav Memorial Foundation (AJMF) is a non-profit, non-governmental organization founded in memory of Anish, the only child of Brigadier Kishor and Mrs. Neeta Jadhav. Anish, who worked as a core technical team member at Nikon India Ltd., inspired his parents to establish a foundation dedicated to a cause close to his heart: empowering underprivileged youth with skills to earn their livelihood.
